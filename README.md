A web app made using flask containing quick access to various important links for the Logic System Designs Class.
Also has a mutibase calculator embedded to it.

### How to use the multibase calculator:
	
	as this can operate on multiple bases ( supported bases ), 
	it is necessary to tell the executer what base the number is in

	Supported bases: (the values are equivalent to 20)
		
		1. Binary :- b(10100)
		2. Octal :- o(24)
		3. Decimal :- d(20)
		4. Hexadecimal :- h(14)

	Return type is decimal!

	Therefore an example expression like : 'h(FFF)+d(20)*o(132)-b(110011)' 
	notice that there are no spaces in between the operand and operators
	can be evaluated to 5844

	Also entering a single operand will return the decimal form of that
